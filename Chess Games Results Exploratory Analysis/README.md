## Chess Games Results Exploratory Analysis

In this project I explored the 'First-move advantage in chess' thesis.

There is a general consensus among chess players and theorists that the player who makes the first move (White) has an inherent advantage.
So, I tried to check this statement statistically using `R` based on the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess).

You can check [pdf](chess_analysis.) version, [Jupyter Notebook]() and [html]() version of this project.
