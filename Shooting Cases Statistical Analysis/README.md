#### Overview
This project is to show the statistical analysis of the shooting cases based on NYPD data collected from 2006 to 2021.<br>
I used `R` and the following libraries and techniques for data cleaning, analysis and visualization:
 - Transforming data (dplyr, lubridate, tidyr, vcd)
 - Visualizing data (ggplot2)
 - Modeling data (Logistic regression, ANOVA)
 - Running the model - prediction (GLM)
