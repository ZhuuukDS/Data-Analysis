## WHO's Life Expectancy Exploratory Data Analysis

<img src='data/who_logo.png' width=400>

#### Task Formulation
I read an article and found that Israel has worldâ€™s 6th-Highest life expectancy according to World Health Organization. That made me feel curious about the details and I found the dataset, where the information gathered by WHO about Life Expectancy in different countries has been stored. This dataset can be found in Kaggle. This is quite informative file, however the data has been gathered only in the period from 2000 to 2015.

Nevertheless, I wanted to analyse this data and find the answers for the following questions:

- What are the predicting variables actually affecting the life expectancy in Israel?
- How does Infant and Adult mortality rates affect life expectancy?
- Does Life Expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.
- What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?
- Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
- What are the life expectancies in the neibouring countries?
- What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life Expectancy?
