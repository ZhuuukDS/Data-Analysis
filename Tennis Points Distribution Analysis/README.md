<img src='rtt.png' height=250>

#### Overview
This study is aimed at analysing the distribution of 'Russian Tennis Tour' points among russian female tennis players under the age of 16.<br>
In this study, I tried to determine the influence of various factors on the number of rating points and identify dependencies and patterns.<br>
I used the `R` language (the 4.2.0 version) for data analysis. <br>
The main statistics and metrics used in this analysis: __mean, median, variance, standard deviation, 1st and 3rd quartiles, confidence levels, p-values__. <br>
To compare groups of observations, __one-factor__ and __two-factor__ methods analysis of variance was used (__ANOVA__).

The following libraries are will be used:
- dplyr
- tidyr
- ggplot2
- gplots
- readxl
